This app was designed to be an educational aid and to help give people opportunity to see indigenous people and the world around them from a pre-colonized perspective. 

When you load a website you will see the icon to (De)Colonize your pages. Initially, pages will appear with the original scripting. Clicking the app will toggle between the colonized terminology and indigenous endonyms. For example, most Cherokee people refer to themselves as Tsalagi (pronounced jah-lah-gee). Toggling the extension will switch between Cherokee and Tsalagi in websites. 

This extension is in beta stage. I am also working on crowdsourcing more indigenous names and hope to include indigenous endonyms from around the world and indigenous names for places over time. 

Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you enjoy learning more about the indigenous people and languages around you.
